(*!
  We can nest patterns as deep as we want
    - Just like we can nest expressions as deep as we want
    - Often avoids hard-to-read, wordy nested case expressions

  So the full meaning of pattern-matching is to compare a pattern
  against a value for the "same shape" and bind variables to the
  "right parts"
